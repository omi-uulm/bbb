# BBB Background

[BBB](https://bigbluebutton.org/) is an OpenSource video conferencing tool. Per se, an installation uses a single server node. It can be extended though by the [scalelite load balancer](https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/scalelite/) and the [Greenlight user Management](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/greenlight/).

## This set-up (description)

This set-up makes use of a set of BBB instances enhanced by a scalelite and a greenlight installation. The entire application has been configured to run on [bwCloud](https://www.bw-cloud.org/), an OpenStack-based cloud installation operated by the universities from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.
